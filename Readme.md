# Project Euler Solutions

Welcome to my personal repository of solutions for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems.

As a **Mathematical Engineering** student, I maintain this repository to improve my skills in algorithm design, number theory, and programming logic.

## 📂 Repository Structure

My goal is to solve problems using both high-level and low-level approaches:

- **Python (`/Python`):** Used for rapid prototyping, logic building, and handling large integers easily.
- **C (`/C`):** *Coming soon.* Will be implemented to demonstrate low-level memory management and algorithmic optimization.

These solutions are shared for educational and archival purposes. If you are currently working on Project Euler problems, I highly recommend solving them yourself first. Copying code defeats the purpose of the challenge!
